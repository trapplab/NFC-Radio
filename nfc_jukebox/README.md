# NFC Radio

This flutter project is a music player app (mainly for mobile due to the need of NFC) that can be controlled by any NFC tag. There is no information saved on the tag itself, but the tag's ID is used to identify the tag. The app will then use the ID to determine which radio file to play.

I wanted to have a simple to use radio which can be used to hear their favorite songs or stories without the need of using a screen. NFC tags can be placed in toys or pictures which can act as a CMI (Child-Machine-Interface) 😉
